    <h2>Plans for the site</h2>

    <p>
      I do plan to expand the website more than just a way for me to <strong>document</strong> and add a <em>way</em> for other people to interact with what I do post on the site.
    </p>

 <p>
      This is a website that documents my thoughts, views, beliefs, and knowledge about the world around us and heavenly things.
