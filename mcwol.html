<h3>My cripes with OldLutheran.com</h3>

    <p>OldLutheran.com is a website that you can buy a variety of lutheran merchandise. Everything from T-shirts to a Martin Luther bobble head. I ended up finding the website because the pastor at my old church had a beer cup that stated "sin boldy" and I was too shy to ask why it was funny and what it meant. I ended up looking it up today and found out it is meant to just be a humurous nod to Luther when he said "If you are a preacher of mercy, do not preach an imaginary but the true mercy. If the mercy is true, you must therefore bear the true, not an imaginary sin. God does not save those who are only imaginary sinners. Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world."</p>

<p>Which is firstly a nod to Martin Luther because he was a beer drinker and enjoyer. He even brewed his own beer in his house. Secondly it is a statement not as a pass to sin but as a humurous way to callback to Luther talking about being truthful about your sinful nature and moreover clinging to Christ sacrafice to atone for our sinful natures. It's a bit of a double untundra (which I hate) because the second meaning is "i'm being upfront and in the open with my sin of drinking this beer. But just joking beer drinking isn't always sinful yet I want to make this callback". There's layers to it -__- in other words it's kind of saying I drink beer like Luther and I want to be funny about it. But in my opinion it's just christian cringe which is unfortunately what I see more often than not when seeing christian products.</p>

<p>That's not what I wanted to talk about in this post though. What I want to talk about is while browser the Lutheran First website I noticed shortly after scrolling down that they have LGBT merch.</p>

<p>It annoys the doo doo out of me seeing this. The LGBT movement is the devils movement. And it's unfortunate that the devil has his influence even on the Lutheran Church. It just goes to show how powerful his influence can be and how easily duped people can be by falling for his tricks.</p>

<p>"Love > Hate", "Love is Love", "We stand against hate" are some of the slogans you often hear from the Lucifer Got Billions Tricked movement. They imply anyone against their movement is hateful and hate gay people. Which is actually incorrect most people do have some hate when it comes to opposing this movement but not what they imply it is. Most people hate the movement and hate that it is being cramed down our throat by TV & movie commercials, YouTube & Netflix ads and reccomendations. The average secular and non secular person knows that this is not a natural and organized occurance of this movements traction but a contrived one and people are tired of it and some fed up. People hate the contrived part the fact people are getting together and influencing mass amounts of people even though they themselves are such a small minority. They are getting together and putting together propaganda to cram down your throat, your kids, and even your grandma. And people despise and hate this.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the second thing when it comes to hating the LGBT movement is that people hate the movement itself. Mostly because of the first reason I listed. People are irritated by the sight of the rainbow flag and the gas lighting slogans that usually go along with the flag. Which is "you are a angry and hateful person if you are not with us because you hate gay people".</p>

<p>Now for me I hate the propaganda and the fact they are a minority yet pushing it on the masses even children. I hate the gas lighting and I hate the movement. But I take it one step further I hate homosexuality. Which is what we are to hate in this world as Christians and Lutheran Christians.</p>

<p>It goes without saying but I do not hate gay people. I do get annoyed by their behavior of trying to push it on everyone else. But this is my sin and I hate that I get so annoyed by it. I am disgusted when I see acts of gayness, especially by men. I think it's rediculous when I see men and women dressing like the opposite sex and expecting everyone to pretend it's normal. But that's another topic I can maybe cover another time.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is labeled as an abomination and it is described as outside of God's design and an impure act. And most importantly it is labeled by God as a sin.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my final point which is it is wrong for the Lutheran First website and owners to have the LGBT propaganda on their website and it is the consequence of the devils strong influence and our weak sinful nature.</p>
