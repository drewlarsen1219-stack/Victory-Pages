<h1>How to build a text based website</h1>
<p>Learning how to build it yourself is the best method, the reason for this is because when I update my website I have to go back into the files to edit them using code.</p>
<p>You can inspect my page to see how I have my pages set up. </p>
<p>I learned how to do it myself and I used Google Gemini for helping me with the more complex stuff like setting up the "paganation" (Next, Previous) buttons.</p>
<p>Most of my website is bloat free, simple and minimilistic as possible while still being useful and aesthetic.</p>
<p>The reason I built it this way because I do not like websites that are too busy with needless flashiness. I am also into the minimilist tech lifestyle which means I simplify my use of technology as much as possible where I can.</p>
