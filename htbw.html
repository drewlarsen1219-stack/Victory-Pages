<h1>How to build a text based website</h1>
<p>Learning how to build it yourself is the best method. You can inspect my page to see how I have my pages set up. 
    I learned how to do it myself and I used Google Gemini for helping me with the more complex stuff like setting up the "paganation" (Next, Previous) buttons.
Most of my website is bloat free and as simple and minimilistic as possible while still being useful and aesthetic.</p>
