    <p>This game has been surprisingly an enjoyable game for me. I think most people find the game ¬_¬ cringe primarily because of the TV show and the over-the-top card battles between Yugi (which is the main characters) and his opponents.</p>

    <p>Even as a kid the cringe is recognizable (idk why I assume you need to be an adult to be able to detect cringe). To add to this bad rapport the TV show gives the game, most people who play the game are the same type of people who play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&D</a> in their basement or in the back of a comic book store. (unhygienic obese nerds).</p>

    <p>I also have gotten into D&D (Capcom video game version) recently but that is info for another time.</p>

    <p>Cringe aside, the card game itself is fun. I enjoy games that have character building or, in this case, deck building. I love games that are strategic and artistic. The game requires you to read each card, which has the description on how the card works and its attack and defense points. Each card also comes with a piece of art that usually matches the card's effect and ATK/DEF points. Example<a href="https://imgur.com/a/5JqIRsu"> here.</a> </p>

    <p>I have been playing this on my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8R1QP51/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?pd_rd_i=B0F8R1QP51&pd_rd_w=TG5Ci&content-id=amzn1.sym.30062d3d-2c31-47f3-af26-55177a669bb5&pf_rd_p=30062d3d-2c31-47f3-af26-55177a669bb5&pf_rd_r=EYFJS22XABZ7YYG9416M&pd_rd_wg=aEgxS&pd_rd_r=47afd042-7cd1-4d1e-82ae-64c74d23f678&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWxfdGhlbWF0aWM&th=1">Game stick</a> which I bought on Amazon. Mind you, this is an older version of the game and was made for the Gameboy originally. The newer versions of the game on the newer consoles I can only talk briefly on because they were too difficult and had too much bloat for my taste.</p>

    <p>There is a version of the game without bloat called  <a href="https://duelingnexus.com/welcome">"Yu-Gi-Oh Nexus"</a> which I did try out on my E Ink tablet thinking it might work for me, but the game is way too hard for beginners. Even the bots used cards/decks that were ridiculously good and would not really even give a beginner a chance to compete.</p>

    <p>I have to go into <a href="https://imgur.com/a/7MY8zLt">work</a>. -_______-</p>

    <p>Until next time. Wait okay I am back the next day.</p>

<p>My plan is to figure out what the in between difficulty and game mode from the old gameboy games where you use the basic cards (fusion cards being the most advanced) and the hyper nerd level where you can play 5+ cards on your first turn and summon multiple monsters on the field easily.</p>

<p>I will update this post once I figure out that in between because the game has a ton of potential.</p>
