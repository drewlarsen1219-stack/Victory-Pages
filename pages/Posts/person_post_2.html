<p><strong>Going back to college</strong></p>

<p>Everything is finished on my end to be admitted as a student now. It took more steps than I expected, but I am usually reminded by the fact most things like this usually take more work and hoops to jump through than I would like them to. ￣へ￣ 

<p><strong>Puppeteering for a local live show</strong></p>

<p>Last year when I first moved to Arkansas I volunteered to help with a Halloween themed live theater show. I met the director of the show through my wife and the owners of the shop that she works at. The show itself was put on and is again put on by the same person and last year it was a fairly simple role that did not take a whole lot of acting skills.</p>

<p>It ended up being fun for me and I enjoyed helping. It was good for me too because I didn't have a job at that point and had a lot of extra time on my hands. The motivation behind it was to be of service to my neighbor where I can. And this was a great opportunity for that</p>

<p>This year I offered to help out again except this time around the difficulty level has gone up because instead of just walking around in a ghost costume I am a puppeteer for a song and story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Llorona">La Llorona</a>. La Llorona is a dark story about a woman who gets her revenge on her cheating husband by drowning her own kids. She then dies and becomes an evil spirit that chases and drowns other children.</p>

<p> I would much rather prefer to be apart of a play that glorifies God and I believe it wouldn't be all that difficult to do considering Halloweens roots in Christian history. The director is a Christian too but a watered down liberal version (more on that later).</p>

<p>If it were up to me or if I was to put on my own show on Oct. 31st I would do one about all the martyrs and saints that died through history following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allhallowtide">Allhallowtide</a> rather than the modern Halloween. But that is what you get when the devil reigns and humans have their free will we choose to do our own thing. It's also the reason why I believe it is so important that as a Christian that choosing your denomination is very important and to study theology and the churches history otherwise there is a good chance you can end up like the director of this show I am in where you are choosing which parts of the Bible to believe and determine as truth and which ones are not.</p>

<p>Last night after rehearsing for the show I brough up that I am next up to be corrected for saying "she" instead of "they" by this girl who is another puppeteer and <em>very</em> liberal. The director attempted to corral me like a Sheppard dog into going along with it. I told her that it goes against my beliefs as a Christian because I believe God defines sexuality not people.</p>

<p>Surprise surprise the director went into a frenzy with arguments on why I am wrong using strawman arguments on how trans people are killing themselves because people are refusing to use their pronouns. Which is hogwash because trans people if they are killing themselves at a rapid rate is because they are mentally ill and struggling with their identity to their sexuality. All of that cannot be easy on the psyche and to add on to that if they are on hormone treatment their mental health is most likely taking hardcore. Which reminds me of transexuals in Thailand who in an interview talked about lowering their doses of hormone treatment because it was causing too much mental health issues like depression. It's just a lie of what is actually going on and an attempt to make people feel and view people who don't bend the knee as the perpetrator and cause of transexual suicides.</p>

<p>Along with that strawman argument there were a few other rapid fire arguments like how animals have both XX chromosomes and XY or something along those lines. Another argument something along the lines if a person looks like a different gender than they were born blah blah blah. Just retarded stuff.</p>

<p>The most offensive part of this interaction was that she was using Jesus and the commandment to love your neighbor and to respect their pronouns is loving them while not is not loving them. I understand that knowing what God's love really looks like isn't always easy to see but that doesn't give you an excuse to twist what the Bible says to try to convince another Christian to go against what God has said and created. It's a perversion and is reminiscent of when the devil was twisting what the prophets in the old testament wrote as an attempt to get Jesus to not follow God.</p>

<p>This interaction was mildly awkward for me even though I thought I was desensitized to awkwardness by working with retarded folk. The rehearsal went great and it's finished now. And this whole thing felt thwarted by the fact this happened. The director became quite after I responded to her word vomit with non argumentative honest statements like "that's just a strawman argument". After awkwardly trying to help clean up afterwards I went home and decided that I don't really care all that much that this all happened and I believe it was a way for me to glorify God.</p>

<p>No stupid human, no matter how you twist and turn God's words and the truth of the world. God defines sexuality not people.</p>
