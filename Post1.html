    <p>This game has been surprisingly an enjoyable game for me. I think most people find the game ¬_¬ cringe primarily because of the TV show and the over-the-top card battles between Yugi (which is the main characters) and his opponents.</p>

    <p>Even as a kid the cringe is recognizable (idk why I assume you need to be an adult to be able to detect cringe). To add to this bad rapport the TV show gives the game, most people who play the game are the same type of people who play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&D</a> in their basement or in the back of a comic book store. (unhygienic obese nerds).</p>

    <p>Cringe aside, the card game itself is fun. I enjoy games that have character building or, in this case, deck building. I love games that are strategic and artistic. The game requires you to read each card, which has the description on how the card works and its attack and defense points. Each card also comes with a piece of art that usually matches the card's effect and ATK/DEF points. Example<a href="https://imgur.com/a/5JqIRsu"> here.</a> </p>

    <p>I have been playing this on my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8R1QP51/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?pd_rd_i=B0F8R1QP51&pd_rd_w=TG5Ci&content-id=amzn1.sym.30062d3d-2c31-47f3-af26-55177a669bb5&pf_rd_p=30062d3d-2c31-47f3-af26-55177a669bb5&pf_rd_r=EYFJS22XABZ7YYG9416M&pd_rd_wg=aEgxS&pd_rd_r=47afd042-7cd1-4d1e-82ae-64c74d23f678&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWxfdGhlbWF0aWM&th=1">Game stick</a> which I bought on Amazon. Mind you, this is an older version of the game and was made for the Gameboy originally. The newer versions of the game on the newer consoles I can only talk briefly on because they were too difficult and had too much bloat for my taste.</p>

    <p>There is a version of the game without bloat called  <a href="https://duelingnexus.com/welcome">"Yu-Gi-Oh Nexus"</a> which I did try out on my E Ink tablet thinking it might work for me, but the game is way too hard for beginners. Even the bots used cards/decks that were ridiculously good and would not really even give a beginner a chance to compete.</p>

    <p>(off topic) Me at <a href="https://imgur.com/a/7MY8zLt">work</a> getting paid so little while others do way less and get paid way more.</p>

<p>As I was playing YGO on the game stick during a lightning storm it reset the power and deleted my saved progress which I almost got to the point where I could not go any further anyways.</p>

<p>My plan is to figure out what the in between difficulty and game mode from the old gameboy games where you use the basic cards (Early Konami/Bandai Rules (Pre-2002) / Forbidden Memories ruleset) where the game is game is slow and grindy with very limited card effects, focus on simple Tributes and Fusion by type. And the hyper nerd level where you can play 5+ cards on your first turn and summon multiple monsters on the field easily. (Post-Link Era) Gemini's description: Link, Xyz, Synchro, Pendulum, and Fusion all used in complex, multi-step combos. Focus on ending the first turn with a massive "board" of protected monsters.</p>

<p>According to Google Gemini searching this up the middle ground that I have been curious about is the "GOAT Format" (Spring 2005) or "Edison Format" (Spring 2010). Where there is more strategy, powerful cards, but a steady pace. Gemini description: Core Synchro/Xyz mechanics are introduced, but the game is still focused on 1-for-1 card advantage. The pace is strategic, not combo-driven.</p>

<p>Gemini: "It is named after the powerful card, Scapegoat, and the card pool is generally limited to cards released up to the set Invasion of Chaos and the ban list of April 2005. Key Features of GOAT Format: Focus on 1-for-1 Trades. Most turns involve playing one card to answer an opponent's one card (e.g., using Mystical Space Typhoon to destroy their set Spell/Trap). Limited Special Summoning: It relies mainly on Fusion and simple Effect Monster summons. There are no Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monsters. Tribute Monsters are King: High-Level monsters like Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning and Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End were the most powerful cards, requiring you to carefully manage your field to summon them. Skill is Positional: The game is won by superior resource management, knowing when to set a card versus playing it immediately, and positioning monsters for the next turn.</p>



<p>Google Gemini recommended that I try out Dueling Book. I tried it out and it is not like playing on the gameboy simulator mainly because the player is in control of all the game functions. I spent a good 45 min racking my memory of my deck that I had on my gamestick and when I finally had my deck put together and tried a dual in "GOAT" mode I was lost on how to use the website and the opponent just quit on me.</p>

<p>I might just give up on the game overall</p>
