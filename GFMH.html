<h3>Guy from my hometown</h3>

    <p>When I am at work I like to ask where my customers are from because it usually is a good conversation starter. A couple days ago when I asked a customer he told me southern California (which is where I am from). I told him that I am from a town called ***** in which the customer told me that the guy he was with is also from ***** (my hometown).</p>

<p>I launched across the room gleefully and said "YOUR'E FROM *****???" He was and he went to my high school too. He graduated three years ahead of me which means that he was in my older brothers graduating class. The world can be a small place sometimes. ⚆_⚆</p>

<p>After chatting with ******* for a while and racking my brain I did end up remembering seeing him a couple times at school. Once when he was at the center of the pavilion at lunch because he stood out due to the fact he was gay and flamboyant looking wearing white aviators and sporting a blonde pompadour with certain sections dyed brown. I also remember seeing him on my bus once sitting at the front by himself. My only thoughts about him were that he was intimidating because he looked "cool" whatever that meant to me at that time. He has sort of sharp canine teeth and was also a senior when I was a just freshmen. A lot of people where intimidating to me at that age.</p>

<p>My thoughts on gay people during that time were not expansive or atypical for a kid that age. During those days in school you did not want to be known as "gay" or a "fag". That was sort of social suicide. Ironically now days you don't want to be known to be thinking gays are something bad otherwise that is the new social suicide.</p>

<p>I was able to talk with *** for a while at my work and we ran names by eachother and eventually found out we had some mutual friends. The part I found most humorus was when we had to use the dress style from that time to identify certain people. We had a mutual friend who was a "bro hoe" (now exctinct) and it was funny to me that the style of bro and bro hoe being the female version of the bro was a lifestyle and dress style.</p>

<p>Being motivated by my faith and lessons of how to love other people from God and the comradre from being from the same hometown I invited them out to get sushi the next day. It's a bit out of the normal for me to invite customers to go do anything and also out of the norm to hang out with gay people.</p>

<p>The next day getting sushi with them was a sucess. They did not try to wrap it up early or anything like that and we ended up hanging out there for at least an hour talking about all sorts of things. It was odd that they were gay, but it didn't bother me. They didn't hit on me (not that I expected that). It's I don't know what to expect when hanging out with gays. Usually I avoid gay people because I most likely disagree with their world views. And on top of that I do not want to be hit on or stuff like that.</p>

<p>Other thing note worthy was that during the conversations they were displaying feminine traits and even the small movements with their eyes displayed this. Not sure if I made this clear but ****** and his "husband" (quotations due to christian belief God implimented marriage for man & woman) were both there for sushi and at my work. And not the husband but *** was the one from my hometown and he was the quiet one compared to his guy man.</p>

<p>When the guy man went to the restroom and I was left at the table with *** (the quiet) one it was a little nerve racking for me and I think for him because he was more obligated to talk, but I liked this fact because I did want to hear more from him. I don't know if all gay people do this or only when gays hang out with normal people (gay is weird to me) but he started to talk more like a normal guy instead of gay and feminine and same with the subject matter (driving his RV).</p>

<p>This phenominon makes me believe he either wanted to try to fit in more since I am not gay or talk that way or he let his non gay side leak through for a few moments. It took me off gaurd. </p>

<p>I opened up to them about my journey pursuing living and working on a white seperatist homestead community which was a little uncomfortable but I felt safe expressing it because I didn't have to defend any sort of positions because now I have moved away from that and towards christianity.</p>

<p>After a couple of hand shakes and recommendations on what all else there is to do in the area worth checking out into the evening sunset they drove and me to to my humble hay stack to end the day. I prayed for *** that night before going to sleep I want to continue praying for him.</p>

<p>The following day we texted each other about how their trip has been and to follow up with my recomendations. He was slow to respond and I became nuerotic about the fact I might have made a mistake sending him a text wall about this stuff but later that evening he texted me back.</p>

<p>I don't remember where I read or heard this from but praying for people close to you is a good thing but praying for people who cross paths with you is also important and who you are able to pray for as well.</p>

<p>I doubt *** will ever not be gay especially since he has been that way at least since 2010 and now it's 2025, but it's not my job as a christian to convert him to not being gay. I am instructed by God to love other people and to hate sin not the sinner. I hate that *** has to be this way but I also hate that I am plaiged with sinning in other ways too like getting angry at people or have had such a long history of consuming pornagraphy and masterbating.</p>

<p>Not sure how to conclude all of this but I think I will end this with I see this as progress in my christian life on how to love other people. It is a beautiful thing.</p>
