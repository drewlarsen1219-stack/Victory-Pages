<h2>Information Collected Automatically</h2>

We operate a text-based website and do not use user registration forms or directly collect personal data like names or email addresses. However, like all websites, certain information is automatically collected by our hosting provider (GitHub) and third-party services (see below) when you access the site:

IP Address: Your unique network address.

Browser Information: The type of browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari) and operating system you use.

Date and Time: The time and duration of your visit.

Referring Source: The website you came from (if any).

We rely on third-party services that may independently collect data.

Embedded Content (e.g., YouTube): Our site embeds content, such as videos from YouTube. When you interact with this embedded content, the third-party service may collect data about you and use its own cookies. We have no direct control over the data collected by these services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these third parties.

External Links: Our pages contain links to external websites (e.g., bookofconcord.org). We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these other sites.

<h2>Data Security and Retention</h2>

We take reasonable steps to protect the limited data we collect from loss or unauthorized access. Since we do not store user accounts or sensitive personal information, data retention is minimal, primarily tied to log files and analytics data kept by third-party services.

<h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>

Depending on your location, you may have the right to request access to the automatically collected data, or request its deletion. Since we do not directly hold identifiable personal information, exercising these rights involves contacting the relevant third-party services (like Google Analytics) directly.
