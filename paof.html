<h3>Powerful acts of forgiveness</h3>

    <p>I am posting here a couple of my favorite videos of acts of forgiveness that we can all learn from and emulate.</p>

<p>These are examples of God's love and reflections of His love being channeled through believers and it is simply beautiful.</p>

This first <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gzc9VAKfCbI"> video</a> is of an Australian man who's two kid's and nephew were trategically run over by a drunk driver. The driver was then sentanced to 20 years in prison. The man forgives this killer and even welcomes him to as a very intimate part of his life.</a>
