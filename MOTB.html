<h3>"Myteries of the Bible" full review</h3>

    <p>"Mysteries of the Bible" by Questar Entertainment. Disc 1-4 were great and I didn't care for 5 and 6 all that much. There was a part in an interview in disc 5 "Heaven our eternal home" that I liked where the man being interviewed talked about people turning their back of Jesus saving them and rejecting Him. And the imagery used in his description of the gates of heaven closing and Jesus shedding a tear right before they close for the people who rejected saving salvation and His love.</p>

<p>The parts that stick out to me the most is the part about the "shroud of turin" and how the scientist who went into studying the shroud in the first place as non believers and sceptics ended up proving it is more likely the real shroud that covered Jesus body in the tomb.</p>

<p>The other part is the part about finding the coral formations in one of the bodies of water that resemble chariot wheels from the same time period of the Egyptians who chased after Moses and the other Isrealites across a body of water that closed up after the Isrealites cross in turn swallowed the Egyptians and Pharoh and drowned them all.</p>
